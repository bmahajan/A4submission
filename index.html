    <h2>Proposition: Reducing Access to Abortion Clinics Does Reduce Abortions</h2>

		<section>
      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="./img/1.png" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					Makes an argument that states that reduced availability of abortion clinics also saw a decrease in % of abortions between 2017 to 2020. Since this visual is meant to appeal to more conservative folks, usage of color and images is employed to indicate how the reduction in abortions is the happy sceanrio. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Overall Graph Type Choice: I wanted to explore whether there is a correlation between changes in the availability of abortion services and changes in the number of abortions. To start, I plotted this information state by state and observed a slight correlation in many states—except for those with the most dramatic changes in abortion care availability.
				</li>
					<li>Initially, I plotted this data using linear trends. However, I later realized that simple linear lines might not fully capture the nuances of the relationship. Additionally, the correlation was not always a direct 1:1 relationship. To account for this—and to present the findings in a way that resonates with more conservative audiences—I categorized the data into buckets, as described below.
				</li>
				<li>New Category of Data: I created a new field, "Change in the Number of Abortion Clinics (2017-2020)", which categorizes states into three groups:
					(1) States where the number of clinics increased (more clinics), 
					(2) States where the number of clinics decreased (likely due to legal restrictions),
					(3) States with no change.
					</li>
				<li>Since abortion is a politically divisive topic in the U.S., I colored the bars to align with typical party stances—blue for increased access (Democrats) and red for restricted access (Republicans)</li>
				<li>Because this visual is intended for a more conservative audience (who may associate reducing abortion access with fewer abortions), I added imagery to reinforce this perspective. Specifically, I included pictures of peacefully sleeping babies in cases where abortions decreased and a crying child in cases where they increased.
				</li>
				<li>Title is also meant to make the visual appeal to a more conservative base.</li>
			</ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="./img/2.png" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					Refutes the claim from Image 1 and visualizes how women in states with reduced abortion care are actually having to travel (throguh different means) to other states to access care. This is meant to appeal to more liberal readers and hence employs images to appeal to the emotion of additional stress and labor for these women. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Overall Design and Data Choice: Next, I wanted to challenge the claim suggested by the first image—that reducing the number of abortion clinics curtails abortions. In reality, it does not eliminate abortions; it simply forces women in affected states to travel further for medical care, increasing their burden.
				</li>
					<li>To strengthen my argument, I filtered the data to include only states where the number of abortion clinics decreased between 2017 and 2020. I then highlighted the corresponding spike in the percentage of residents from these states who traveled out of state for abortion care.
					Since this visual is intended to appeal to more liberal audiences, it focuses on the negative consequences of restricting abortion access—specifically, the additional burden placed on women.
					</li>
				<li>The two lines mirror each other, particularly in states with the most significant declines in abortion care availability, such as Missouri indicating that reducing services is not the miracle solution that the first graph suggests it is. 
				</li>
				<li>Selective data choice to make graph more convincing:  I included only states with a decline in clinic availability to present a clearer trend. Including all states made the chart harder to read and weakened the argument, as there were always exceptions (e.g., Washington, D.C., where the correlation was less pronounced).
				</li>
				<li>Added small icons of the bus and airpplane at the start of the blue line since those are used to travel to other states.</li>

				<li> I used red to represent reduced abortion access and blue to show the percentage of women traveling out of state for care. (mirroring political views on the topic in the US)
				</li>
				<li>Appeal to Emotion:  I added an image of a distressed woman in the background to emphasize the additional burden placed on women who must travel long distances to access essential healthcare.
				</li>

			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      While working on this assignment, I encountered several design and ethical dilemmas:
		<ul>
		<li>For each visualization—whether supporting or opposing the main argument—I tailored the design to resonate with a specific audience. My choice of data, labels, and even imagery (e.g., a distressed woman, a crying baby) was intentionally selected to appeal to that audience.
		</li>
		<li>In both cases, I selectively chose data points, and in one instance, I even reframed the labels to ensure the visual aligned with the point I was trying to make.
		</li>
		<li>I realized that any attempt to create a more neutral, balanced visualization resulted in something that felt bland and was likely to be ignored by most viewers.
		</li>
		<ul>
		
    </section>
	<section>These observations led me to deeper ethical questions:
		<ol>
		<li> What was my ultimate goal? Was it simply to attract as many viewers as possible?
		</li>
		<li> If so, which audience was I prioritizing, and why?
		</li>
		<li>As a visual creator, is it my responsibility to craft a visualization that speaks to everyone?
		</li>
		4. In a real-world scenario—where I might be part of an organization with a specific agenda—can I even be effective in visual storytelling without strategically selecting data, images, and emotional cues?
	</ol>
		If the answer is no, then perhaps I need to accept that creating a compelling visual inherently involves taking a stance. True neutrality may be impossible because the very act of designing a visual requires making choices—about what to include, what to omit, and how to frame the narrative.</section>
